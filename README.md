# Versus Development
HelloðŸ‘‹. This is **VD GitHub** and I am its founder - **Bockster6669**. My goal is to create new and interesting scripts for the FiveM community, having a fairly complete experience in GTA scripting. Here you can find free ones and in Tebex you can also find paid scripts. We also have a discord that you can go in and check out if you want. The scripts are written in lua, but there are also some written in C# that haven't been uploaded yet.

### I am currently working on studying computer science in C#
### You can reach me through Discord, that is in bio
